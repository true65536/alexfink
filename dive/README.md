# Dive ×÷
Dive ×÷ is another 2048-like blending additive and multiplicative number theory, created by [65536](github.com/true65536/) Based on Dive by [Allen Knutson](https://www.google.com/+AllenKnutson) and implemently simular to Div by [TheMoreYouKnow](https://github.com/themoreyouknow).

If you're reading this, you probably already know what 2048 is, so forgive me for keeping this short.
